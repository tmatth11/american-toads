					The American toad is the most broadly distributed species of the
					family Bufonidae in North America. They can be found in parts of
					every southeastern state except for Florida. American toads are
					spread out in places such as north to eastern Manitoba, parts of
					Ontario and Quebec, the Maritime Provinces, and southern
					Newfoundland. Their range also covers the northeastern United States
					and the Midwest states to eastern Kansas and the Dakotas. Dwarf
					American toads live as far as northeastern Texas and eastern
					Oklahoma.
				</p>
				<p class="content">
					American toads reside in terrestrial habitats ranging from hardwood
					or pine hardwood to white pine-eastern hemlock forests. These toads
					are not opposed to open fields and pastures or residential areas
					either, as long as the habitat has accumulated leaf litter, sandy or
					loamy soil for burrowing, wet hiding places, and a surplus of food.
					They need shallow bodies of water that are free of fish in order to
					mate- these may be temporary ponds, ditches on the side of the road,
					or the margins of lakes.

					American toads in the Southeast start their breeding season in
					January or February. Their breeding season can last until March to
					July in most of their range. Male American toads will group and sing
					together in order to call the females to the wetlands, but they also
					sing on warm, moist days during the height of the season. The call
					of a male is a drawn-out, high-pitched, musical croak that lasts
					6-30 seconds. After calling out the female toads, the male toad
					selects his mate. Then, the female deposits her 2,000-20,000 eggs in
					two, gelatinous strands in a pond.
				</p>
				<p class="content">
					These egg strands attach to nearby vegetation or either lie at the
					bottom of the pond as deep as 2-4 inches until they hatch 3-12 days
					later. Tadpoles grow up to be 2 months old before becoming toadlets.
					They reach their reproduction state at 2-3 years old.

					These toads are usually nocturnal. They spend daylight hours
					underground or under-cover. When cold weather arrives, American
					toads burrow themselves into the ground and hibernates.
				</p>
				<p class="content">
					Fortunately, these toads don't cause warts; however, they still
					produce a toxin in their glands behind their eyes that can harmful
					if swallowed by a human. The toxin can also be harmful if it gets in
					a human's eyes. This toxin is used to protect themselves from some
					predators. If these predators aren't affected by the toxin, the
					American toad will puff itself up to appear bigger than it actually
					is.
